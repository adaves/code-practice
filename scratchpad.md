# Python Comprehensions Practice App - Progress & Plans

## Completed Tasks

- **Streamlined the codebase:**
  - Removed all `.ipynb` files (comprehensions_.ipynb, Comprehensions.ipynb, list_comprehensions.ipynb)
  - Deleted `extract_examples.py` utility
  - Removed related functionality (export_for_ml method) from main code
  - Removed ml_training_data.json reference from .gitignore
  - Simplified requirements.txt by removing unnecessary dependencies

## Current Focus

1. **Complete JSON file**
   - Fill in null/empty exercises
   - Ensure all exercises have proper test cases

2. **Improve Security** (Item #3)
   - Replace the `exec()` evaluation with safer alternatives
   - Implement sandboxed code execution

3. **Expand Functionality** (Item #4)
   - Add more practice types beyond comprehensions
   - Implement difficulty progression
   - Add new exercise categories

4. **Improve Documentation** (Item #7)
   - Add clear usage instructions
   - Document code better with docstrings
   - Create a README file

5. **Add Automated Tests** (Item #8)
   - Create unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement test cases for exercise validation

## Next Steps

1. Review and complete the JSON file:
   - Identify and fill in null exercises
   - Add test cases where missing
   - Organize by difficulty levels

2. Implement safer code evaluation:
   - Research code sandbox options
   - Replace current exec() implementation with a safer alternative
   - Consider using ast.literal_eval or restricting execution context

3. Add documentation:
   - Create a README.md with clear instructions
   - Add docstrings to methods in code_practice.py 

## Updated Project Checklist (Based on Latest User Requests)
This checklist incorporates new goals for improvements, expansions, and features. Items will be checked off as completed.

### Security and Evaluation
- [ ] Implement safer evaluation if needed (low priority since solo user)

### JSON Exercises and Validation
- [x] Add two new easy comprehensions: one basic filtering, one easy dictionary comprehension
- [x] Create /tests directory and add pytest for JSON validation (ensure no null fields in exercises)
- [x] Implement basic tests starting with JSON validation

### Documentation
- [x] Add Google-style docstrings to all public methods in code_practice.py
- [x] Add inline comments explaining key logic in code_practice.py
- [x] Create README.md with sections: Project Overview, Usage (detailed instructions), Contributing, Learning Goals

### Daily Questions and Difficulty Adjustment
- [ ] Add daily question mode in code_practice.py (e.g., --daily flag)
- [ ] Implement difficulty selection based on overall score from scores.txt (>80% medium/hard, 50-80% easy/medium, <50% easy; average all sessions)
- [ ] Randomly select daily challenges across categories

### Saving Challenges and Answers
- [ ] Implement saving of all challenge questions and user answers (e.g., to a new practice_history.json for LLM context)

### Category and Exercise Management
- [ ] Modify code_practice.py to prompt for category and add new categories to JSON if not present
- [ ] Allow adding new questions via code_practice.py prompts, saving to JSON

### Dependencies and Expansions
- [x] Add libraries to requirements.txt for ML/data analysis (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- [ ] Support building sample datasets for ML tasks using pandas/numpy

### Testing and TDD
- [ ] Follow TDD for all new code changes: write tests first, then implement

### Other
- [x] Clarify and integrate workflow_state.md if different from scratchpad.md (note: workflow_state.md is AI-managed for autonomous progress; scratchpad.md can reference it)

## Session Notes
- Created workflow_state.md for behind-the-scenes tracking.
- User pausing for the day; all changes committed and pushed to GitHub.
- Reference workflow_state.md for detailed pending tasks and resumption notes.
